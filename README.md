# Robo-Advisor
 Computes the optimal portfolio for a person based on a set of external inputs by undertaking the following steps:

1. Compute the Sharpe-optimal (optimal risky) portfolio
2. Estimate the client's risk aversion level based on the choices made in a risk elicitation task
3. Explain how to compute, based on the information you have generated, the optimal complete portfolio, 
   that is, the portfolio consisting of a position in a risk-free asset and the Sharpe-optimal (optimal risky) portfolio
4. Compute, based on your computations above, the optimal complete portfolio
